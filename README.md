# Return To Sender

A narrative-driven email simulation game about the impossible balance between career ambition and personal relationships.

## Overview

**Return To Sender** is an interactive story told through an email inbox interface. You play as someone caught between mounting workplace pressure and a deteriorating relationship. Every decision you make or avoid has consequences that unfold over five critical days.

The game explores themes of communication, priorities, and the cost of success through a familiar medium we all know too well: our inbox.

## Story

You receive a mysterious warning email from yourself in the future. Over the next five days (February 10-14, 2016), you'll navigate increasingly difficult choices between your career and your relationship with your wife. Can you keep both? Or will you lose everything trying?
